# Determining The Best Performing Type Of Films At The Box Office
## Project Overview
* A detailed finding of which types of films make the most revenue at the box office.
* Clean and explore the different types of datasets and find out which datasets are best suited for this project.
* Merge the different datasets I have decided to use.
* Communicate insights using visualizations, clearly depicting which types of films the head of the movie studio should create in the new movie studio.
## Business Understanding
Project goals:
1. Explore the different datasets showing the reviews, budgets, and gross.
2. Find the type of films that perform well at the Box Office.
3. Provide the head of the movie studio with information on which type of movies to create.
## Data & Methodology
* Data source: The datasets used for this project were Box Office Mojo and the numbers dataset, which contained movie titles, the domestic, foreign and worldwide grosses for the movies.
* Data Cleaning: I used pandas to fill in  missing values using median and dropped  columns that I didn't need and further dropped rows containing missing values. This made the merged dataset easy to work with and interpret.
* Methodology: I used exploratory data analysis to display my findings, getting the movies that generated the largest and smallest revenue. I was able to identify movies that incurred profits or losses. I also created visualizations using Tableau.
## Conclusion
* The movies with the largest revenue at the Box office are Action/Sci-fi movies, so the head of the new movie studio should create Action/Sci-fi films.
* Creating movies sometimes requires a lot of capital, so the head of the new movie studio should ensure they have the funding as they partake in this new venture.
* The head of the new movie studio should research  what the audience wants to see to avoid having a box office bomb like the Dark Phoenix movie, meaning they should have good writers and directors at their disposal.
 ## Recommendations
* Create Action/Sci-fi movies since they generate high revenue and have large profit margins.
* Create Romance/Adventure movies to diversify their  source of income.
* Create fantasy movies.
* Create high-budget films since some of the highest-grossing films had a big budget, as you might have a chance of making even more money by ensuring the quality of the movie is good, as they say, high risk, high reward.
* The head of the new movie studio should also be cost-effective since some of the movies with low budgets have gotten a return on their investment  at the Box office.
* Create low to mid-budget films because they're a new studio in the film industry and see the reception.
